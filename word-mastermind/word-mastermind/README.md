# Word Mastermind

This game is a clone of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
It's like the [MasterMind game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), but instead of colors you have to guess words.

## Why?

* The original game only allows one word per day. This one can be played endlessly.
* Can work with custom dictionary files

## Demo

You can try it out on Glitch:

* [English](https://word-mastermind.glitch.me/)
* [Romanian](https://word-mastermind.glitch.me/?dictName=ro-ro-5)
* [Romanian (6 letter words)](https://word-mastermind.glitch.me/?dictName=ro-ro-6)
* [Swedish](https://word-mastermind.glitch.me/?dictName=sv-se-5)
* [Dutch](https://word-mastermind.glitch.me/?dictName=nl-nl-5)

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to guess a target word.

To do so, you enter guesses and the game will provide feedback for each letter of your guess:

* a letter that is placed in the correct spot will be marked green
* a letter that is present in the target word, but incorrectly placed will be marked yellow
* the unmarked letters are simply not present in the target word

All submitted guesses have to be valid words.

To make it easy, the keyboard at the bottom of the screen will highlight the statuses of each letter: present (green), not present (dark gray), unknown (light gray).
